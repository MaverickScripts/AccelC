# AccelC
AccelC is a lightweight domain-specific compiler prototype in C that translates a custom high-level toy syntax into equivalent C code, performs conditional branching, arithmetic expansion, and code generation, then invokes gcc for compilation and executionâ€”simulating end-to-end compilation workflow.
